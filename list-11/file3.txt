Once upon a time, son,
they used to laugh with their hearts
and laugh with their eyes:
but now they only laugh with their teeth,
while their ice-block-cold eyes
search behind my shadow.There was a time indeed
they used to shake hands with their hearts:
but thatâ€™s gone, son.
Now they shake hands without hearts
while their left hands search
my empty pockets.
